Check the **setup.properties** to make sure you have the correct license and version for MQ 

```
Usage:
./MQ_setup.sh -i <student number> -n <student namespace>
```

This example is using student2 with namespace of student2
```
./MQ_setup.sh -i 2 -n student2
```

You will be asked if the Namespace and instance number are correct.  enter y/n

This will then create all build scripts for the MQ labs [streamQ, nativeHA, and unicluster].
